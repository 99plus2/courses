Please read the file


https://github.com/joearms/courses/blob/master/1_day/Course_preparation

and follow the instructions in the file.

Note: It is possible that I will make last-minute changes to this
archive - so the best thing to do is test that everything works now,
then check the day before the course to see if there have been any
last minute changes.

Brave souls can fix any errors they find in the material :-)

Have fun.
